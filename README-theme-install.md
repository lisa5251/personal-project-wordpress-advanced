To install this theme on your local WordPress site:

1. Copy the `final-wordpress-project` folder into your WordPress themes directory, for example:

   C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes\final-wordpress-project

2. Or create a ZIP of the `final-wordpress-project` folder and upload via WP Admin → Appearance → Add Theme → Upload Theme.

PowerShell command to create a ZIP (run from the repo root):

Compress-Archive -Path .\final-wordpress-project\* -DestinationPath .\final-wordpress-project.zip -Force

After copying or uploading, reload Appearance → Themes. If the theme still appears under "Broken Themes", ensure:
- The `style.css` file exists directly inside the theme folder (not nested).
- The theme folder name is exactly `final-wordpress-project` (no trailing dashes).
- File permissions allow the web server to read the files.

If you prefer, tell me and I'll instead create `index.php`, `single.php`, and `page.php` more fully, or create a ZIP here if you can allow terminal commands.
